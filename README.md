# TwitterSentiment

Observations:

1. Sentiment data can very wildly based on the current news but based on my multi day observations the news networks react in a fairly similar manner. The day I did my current analysis is when the terror attack in Munster, Germany took place. Because of this all of the sampled news agencies had a very negative view.
2. While most of the news agencies hovered around -.15 and 0 CBS news was drastically more negative about the news in Munseter with a compound value of almost -0.25
3. The homework instructions left the final bar chart a little up in there air as to what the overall sentiment was. I toyed with using the mean sentiment or the median sentiment but decided on the mean because a majority of the last tweets were all about one theme, Terrorism. I believe the median value would be more relevant had the new coverage for the day been more diverse.
